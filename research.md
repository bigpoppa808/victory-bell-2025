## 2. Personal Brand Positioning (Haotian / Adapt for Yourself)

Use or adapt this framing when you introduce yourself:

> **Short intro (15 seconds)**
> "Hi, I’m Haotian. I’m a UCLA Anderson EMBA and founder of Patriot Conceptions, a veteran-owned surrogacy and egg donation agency based in Irvine. We help intended parents, veterans, and LGBTQ+ families build families through third-party reproduction in a more transparent, tech-enabled way. I’m also building TrustUS, a legal-tech escrow platform to make fertility payments safer and more compliant."

> **Extended intro (30–45 seconds)**
> "My background is in engineering and entrepreneurship. After seeing how broken fertility journeys can be – especially for veterans – I started Patriot Conceptions to combine ethical surrogacy/egg donation with real operational excellence. We’ve grown into a multi-million dollar business, partnered with leading clinics, and now I’m using my Anderson experience and Hoover fellowship to push for better veteran fertility benefits. Today I’m mainly here to connect with people in healthcare, benefits, finance, and policy who care about reproductive access and family-building."

Adapt these to your style.

### 6.1 For Doctors, Clinic Leaders, & Health Executives

I’d love to learn how your clinic approaches third-party reproduction and see if there’s room to collaborate."

### 6.2 For Benefits / HR / Employer-Side People

If this is on your roadmap, I’d love to share what we’re seeing in the market."

### 6.3 For Policy / Public Sector / Nonprofit Folks

### 6.5 For Creatives, Influencers, & Media

> "Family-building stories are some of the most powerful narratives out there. We’re looking for collaborators to help tell them ethically – podcasts, short-form content, and long-form features. If you’re into meaningful content with real impact, I’d love to brainstorm."
